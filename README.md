You can go on the website directly with this link : https://websem-velo.vercel.app

Notes : 

We used Jena Fuseki to store our ontology,

the website is responsive (you can go on your phone 📱 ),

the website asks for your position to show you the station in the smallest distance order 📍 ,

you can click on any stations on the left and the map will zoom to its position,

you can pass your mouse near the station to have all the needed informations,

the datas are refreshed every 3 min once you are on the website so it is live data 🗓.

We used next.js.
